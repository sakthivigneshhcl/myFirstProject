## Welcome to ING Training Session
This is the training document for the people joining ING. This site is set up so that we can have a single clearing place for documentation about training.

In our proposal for ING, we promised to create a team that is different than the usual enterprise application development. Specifically, we wanted to deliver a team that has the following characteristics:

1. The team itself is very flat hierarchy. That is, the team works not by dictat, but by having clear guidelines of working.
2. The team is collaborative in ways of working. That is, the tools and the processes are conducive to collaboration.
3. The members themselves use the modern development practices. That means, they write, they use the tools effectively, they automate, they create.
